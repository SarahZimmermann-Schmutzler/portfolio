    <span translate>Hi, my name is Sarah Lucia Zimmermann-Schmutzler.
        I'm a Frontend Developer from Dresden, Germany. I'm married and from August 2023 on I have two children.
        From 2013 to 2019 I studied Health Management (B.A.) and Public Health (MPH).
        But an interesting academic subject makes no fascinating way of working.
        So I decided in 2022 to learn coding professionaly and I attended the Frontend-Course of the Developer
        Akademie. <br>Coding catches me like a fever and I want more!
        I look forward to use my knowledge in practice and improve my skills.
        That's why Frontend is not the end - I absolutely want to become also a Backend Developer.</span>

    <span class="lil-text" translate> In the future maybe I can bring together my passion of coding and my academic knowledge
        about the german health care system. But that's not the only subject to code for! </span>
